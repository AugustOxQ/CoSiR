# Embedding Manager Performance Investigation

**Date:** 2025-09-11
**Problem:** Training gets slower with larger chunk sizes and disk storage mode

## Investigation Summary

### Key Findings

**Storage Mode Performance:**
- Memory mode: Get 0.0001s, Update 0.0356s
- Disk mode: Get 0.0012s, Update 0.0098s

**Chunk Size Impact (Disk Mode):**
- Correlation with total time: 0.1482

**Auto-Sync Impact:**
- With auto-sync: 0.0453s
- Without auto-sync: 0.0001s
- Performance ratio: 697.44x

### Root Cause Analysis

Based on the TrainableEmbeddingManager implementation review:

1. **Inefficient Chunk Loading in Disk Mode:**
   - `_load_embeddings_from_disk()` loads entire chunks for each batch
   - No intelligent caching strategy like FeatureManager
   - Larger chunks = more unnecessary data loaded per operation

2. **Redundant Disk I/O with Auto-Sync:**
   - `_sync_updated_samples_to_disk()` triggers on every update
   - Loads, modifies, and saves entire chunks repeatedly
   - No batching of sync operations

3. **Cache Management Issues:**
   - `loaded_chunks` dictionary grows without intelligent eviction
   - No LRU or size-based cache management
   - Memory usage can grow unbounded

### Recommended Optimizations

1. **Implement Intelligent Caching:**
   - Add LRU cache with size limits
   - Pre-load adjacent chunks based on access patterns
   - Share caching strategy with FeatureManager

2. **Batch Sync Operations:**
   - Accumulate dirty chunks and sync in batches
   - Add configurable sync intervals
   - Implement async sync for non-critical updates

3. **Optimize Chunk Size Selection:**
   - Align chunk boundaries with typical batch sizes
   - Consider embedding access patterns in training
   - Add automatic chunk size optimization

4. **Memory Management:**
   - Implement chunk cache eviction policies
   - Add memory pressure monitoring
   - Provide cache statistics and tuning
